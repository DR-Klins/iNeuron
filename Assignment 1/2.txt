What is the difference between string and variable?

=>  A string is a type of information which could be anything that is enclosed within [quotes]" " irrespective of what is within it, for
    example it could be an alphabet, integer, special charachters etc wihtin the quotes
    Whereas variable is where you could store different types of information, one of which is the String type.
    When you declare a variable certain amount of memory gets allocated depending on the type and size of the variable initialised.

    ex:- var_a = "abC123@#$"

    In the above example var_a is the variable and "abC123@#$" is string
