Describe three different data types.

1 - Numeric type consists of int,float,complex

    In python 3, int has unlimited size which consists all the negative integers,
    positive integers and also zero
    e.g.:- a = 10

    Float are just values with decimals which has a maximum size of 64-bit
    e.g.:- a = 10.01

    complex numbers can also be defined in python
    e.g.:- a = 3+6j

2 - Sequence Types consists of list,tuple, range
    
    As its name suggests List could be a list of similar or different data types  stored
    in variable which is also mutable
    e.g.:- a = ["a",2,[1,2,3]]

    Whereas Tuple is similar to List but it isn't mutable
    e.g.:- a = ("a",2,[1,2,3])

    it creates a Sequence of numbers provided from the number provided by incrementing 1 at a time
    e.g.:- range(5)

3 - Boolean Type just gives two outputs either 1 or 0 based on the condition which could be also
    interpreted as true and false
